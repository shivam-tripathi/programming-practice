 * 13. Roman to Integer
 *
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/
 *
 * Easy
 *
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D
 * and M.
 *
 * Symbol Value
 *
 * I 1
 *
 * V 5
 *
 * X 10
 *
 * L 50
 *
 * C 100
 *
 * D 500
 *
 * M 1000
 *
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added
 * together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is
 * written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is
 * written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There
 * are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *
 * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. X can be placed
 * before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. C can be placed before D (500)
 * and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "III" Output: 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "IV" Output: 4
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: s = "IX" Output: 9
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: s = "LVIII" Output: 58 Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
 *
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: s = "MCMXCIV" Output: 1994 Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90
 * and IV = 4.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 15 s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C',
 * 'D', 'M'). It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1,
 * 3999]
