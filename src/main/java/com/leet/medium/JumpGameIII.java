 *
 * Medium
 *
 * Given an array of non-negative integers arr, you are initially positioned at
 * start index of the array. When you are at index i, you can jump to i + arr[i]
 * or i - arr[i], check if you can reach to any index with value 0. Notice that
 * you can not jump outside of the array at any time.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5 Output: true
 *
 * Explanation: All possible ways to reach at index 3 with value 0 are: index 5
 * -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 ->
 * index 3
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0 Output: true
 *
 * Explanation: One possible way to reach at index 3 with value 0 is: index 0 ->
 * index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 Example 3: Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
 * Output: false Explanation: There is no way to reach at index 1 with value 0.
 * Constraints: 1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104 0 <= arr[i] < arr.length 0 <= start <
 * arr.length
