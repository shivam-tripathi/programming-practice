    - Station Manager
- Colleagues (Train)
    - Passenger Train
    - Freight Train


# Mediator vs Observer
The Mediator pattern can be implemented by using the observer pattern. However it can also be implemented by having Colleagues (roughly equivalent to the Subjects of the Observer pattern) have a reference to either a Mediator class or a Mediator interface.
